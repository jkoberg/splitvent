# *splitvent* - Designs and Tools to help multiply available Ventilators

This project includes designs for 3D-printed ventilator "Y" splitters, 3D printed flow restrictors, and Raspberry Pi software to monitor per-patient respiratory flow with a [Sensirion SFM-3x00 series inline flow sensor](https://www.sensirion.com/en/flow-sensors/mass-flow-meters-for-high-precise-measurement-of-gases/low-pressure-drop-mass-flow-meter/)

We are releasing our work early and often, and in a form that we hope interested individuals can reproduce.

# Quick Start

## 3D Printing Models

* Models have been printed with FDM printers using PLA or PETG.
* TPU can be used for an o-ring.
* Other materials such as Med610, Dental SG/LT, and Teeth A2 can be used and should be considered for sterilization purposes. 

* Models printed with FDM should use 10-20% infill with supports touching buildplate.

## Monitoring Software

* Fabricate a cable to connect to the sensor's connector surface contact lands. 

* Connect your RPi to the Sensirion sensor as shown in the image below:
       ![splitvent schematic of RPi connected to Sensirion sensor](./engineering/Schematic.jpg)

* Download the [RPi disk image](https://splitvent.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/splitvent_rpi_image_20200329.zip), unzip, and write to an 8GB or greater SD card. Follow the [instructions here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)

* Install the SD card into the RPi

* Plug in an HDMI monitor

* Power on the RPi

* Hit ctrl-c a few times to stop the console app

* run "git pull" to get latest GUI changes

* logout

You'll see a UI like this:
